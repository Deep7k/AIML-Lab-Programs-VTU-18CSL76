## VTU AIML Lab Experiments:
<br>
    1. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the
    candidate-Elimination algorithm output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training
    examples.
<br>
<br>
    2. Implement A* search algorithm
<br>
<br>
    3. Implement AO* algorithm
<br>
<br>
    4. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set
    for building the decision tree and apply knowledge to classify a new sample
